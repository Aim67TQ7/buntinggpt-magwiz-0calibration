PCB.md: Magnetic Cross Belt Separators (CBS)
I. Overview and Applications
The Magnetic Cross Belt (CBS) is a heavy-duty magnetic separator used across various recycling and material handling industries to capture and remove ferrous tramp metal from a conveyed product stream.
Nomenclature and Types
• CBS stands for Cross Belt Systems.
• The highest volume of cross belts built and sold utilize Ceramic 8 strontium ferrite permanent magnets.
• Some applications use Neodymium (Neo) permanent magnets for a higher intensity field.
• Occasionally, competitors or specialized systems utilize electro cross belts.
Primary Industries Utilizing Cross Belts
Magnetic cross belts are utilized across numerous applications where large-scale ferrous metal separation is required:
• Plastic Recycling: The number one application, utilized across almost every type of plastic recycling process.
• Metal and Automotive Recycling (ASR): Virtually every metal recycling facility uses multiple cross belts.
• Tire Recycling: A huge user, often requiring multiple cross belts to pull out tire wire during various stages of shredding.
• Aggregates, Concrete, Wood Chip, and Municipal Recycling: Used for pulling out materials like nails, screws, and large pieces of ferrous waste.
• Electronic Separation: Requires higher intensity fields, sometimes leading to the use of rare earth (Neo) cross belts.
II. Sizing and Magnetic Reach Out
Cross belts are dimensioned based on the width of the main conveying belt below them, the depth of the material burden, and the required magnetic strength (reach out).
Physical Dimensions
• Length (Coverage): The plate magnet inside the cross belt should be approximately eight inches or more longer than the width of the lower conveying belt to ensure full coverage of the material stream.
• Width Range: Cross belts accommodate lower conveyor widths ranging from about one foot wide up to seven or eight feet wide.
• Common Lengths: Common cross belt magnetic lengths include 36 and 48 inches.
Magnetic Sizing (Reach Out)
The required magnetic strength is directly proportional to the width of the magnetic assembly used: The wider the magnetic assembly inside the frame, the more reach out it has.
Magnet Assembly Width
Typical Reach Out (Ceramic 8)
Application Requirement Example
24 inches
8 to 10 inches
Low burden depth (e.g., 6 to 8 inches set distance)
30 inches
8 to 12 inches
Moderate reach requirements
36 inches
10 to 16 inches
Deep reach requirements (e.g., set 18 inches away for municipal waste with large items)
Required magnetic strength (Gauss or flux density) is higher when the material burden is thicker, more dense, or if the metal pieces being pulled out are small (such as fine wires).
III. Magnet Types and Design Specifics
Ceramic (Ferrite) Cross Belts
• Ceramic 8 magnets are the most common type used.
• Ceramic plate magnets have one primary magnetic loop running from the North Pole through the South Pole.
• The poles go lengthwise with the conveyor frame to maintain a consistent strong field across the lower belt's width.
Neodymium (Neo) Cross Belts
• Neo magnets provide a higher intensity field and are typically reserved for applications requiring fine separation, like electronic separation or when shredded material is low on the belt.
• Neo plate magnets generally have less reach out than large ceramic plates.
• Design Caution (Tire Wire): Neo cross belts generate large side magnetic loops. In applications handling highly magnetic material (like tire wire), the belt must be significantly wider than the Neo plate magnet (e.g., a 24-inch Neo plate should have at least a 30-inch wide belt) to prevent wire from being pulled off the edge and accumulating inside the frame, which causes belt damage.
Magnetic Circuitry and Maintenance
• All cross belts made by Bunting utilize a two-pole plate magnet design.
• The strong magnetic field of a cross belt requires that the surrounding areas be properly designed, as it is a big magnetic field.
IV. Installation and Anti-Contamination Requirements
Proper installation is critical to prevent the magnetic field from interfering with the separation process or damaging equipment.
Non-Ferrous Requirements
• Lower Conveyor Frame: The frame of the lower conveyor below the cross belt (and extending at least one to two feet on either side) must be made of non-ferrous material (e.g., 300 series stainless steel, wood, or plastic).
• Risk of Magnetization: If the cross belt is suspended over a mild steel frame, the frame will become magnetized. This causes the metal below the belt to be held down by the magnetized frame, preventing it from snapping up to the cross belt, leading to missed metal separation.
• Inline Applications: When a cross belt is run in line over a discharge pulley, that pulley must also be stainless steel to prevent it from being magnetized and holding the tramp metal down.
Belt Stability and Cleaning
• UHMW Skirting: UHMW skirting is used along the bottom edges of the cross belt, machined to hold the belt up and prevent sagging. Sagging can cause contamination (metal fines/wire) to work its way between the belt and the magnetic plate, building up inside the system.
• Cleats: Cleats are often inset on the cross belt to aid in pulling the collected metal off the magnet surface.
Tire Recycling Specific Design (Deluxe Cross Belt)
Due to the extreme magnetism of tire wire, specialized cross belt designs are often required:
1. Extended Frame: The conveyor frame may be made approximately 12 inches longer (six inches further on both ends) to create more distance between the pulleys and the plate magnet.
2. Stainless Steel Pulleys: Drive and tail pulleys are constructed from stainless steel to prevent magnetization.
3. Access Doors: Access clean-out doors are installed behind the drive pulley and in front of the tail pulley to allow manual removal of fine wire that works its way inside the frame.
4. Urethane Belts: A poured urethane topped rubber belt with urethane cleats is sometimes utilized to prevent tire wires from impregnating the belt surface.
V. Electromagnets and Competitors (Emax / Electro)
The sources distinguish permanent magnetic systems (like CBS) from systems relying on electrical components:
• Electro Cross Belts: These are occasionally utilized, particularly in auto recycling facilities, possibly to allow for more clearance on the belts for irregular materials.
• Electromagnet Risks: Permanent magnet systems (like Bunting's proprietary pneumatic rotary switches, which were alternatives to electrical switches) are favored because they involve no heat. Competitor electrical switches (electromagnets) have been known to pose a fire hazard in oily press room environments.
• Variable Magnetism: Competitor systems (such as Redrich disc separators) rely on electromagnets because they allow the Gauss intensity to be changed for purifying materials like sand and Zurich (stainless steel).
• Emax/Eries: A competitor known as "Eries" is mentioned, characterized by spectacular marketing and creativity on verbiage.
